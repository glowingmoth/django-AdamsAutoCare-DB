## The purpose of reusing this project idea (If you've seen my React version) was to learn Python and Django.

Django being a framework allows you to create both the front and backend, and so far I'm really loving it!
The plan after becomming more comfortable with Django is to start incorparating React for the front end, as single page applications become more popular.
